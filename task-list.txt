Task List for Yield Farming Protocol
1. Initial Setup
Create a directory structure:
Folder: /contracts
Folder: /test
Folder: /scripts
Folder: /frontend


2. Smart Contract Development
Token Contracts:
File: /contracts/LPtoken.sol - Implement the LP (Liquidity Provider) token.
File: /contracts/RewardToken.sol - Implement the reward token similar to LPtoken but potentially with extra features.
Yield Farming Contract:
File: /contracts/YieldFarm.sol - Main contract for yield farming logic.


3. Contract Testing
Unit Tests for Tokens:
File: /test/LPtoken.test.js - Write tests for minting and burning functionalities of LPtoken.
File: /test/RewardToken.test.js - Test specific functionalities introduced in the RewardToken.
Unit Tests for Yield Farming:
File: /test/YieldFarm.test.js - Comprehensive tests covering staking, rewards, and withdrawal functionalities.


4. Frontend Integration
Setup and Basic Integration:
File: /frontend/src/App.js - Set up React application structure.
File: /frontend/src/utils/web3.js - Integrate Web3 or ethers.js for blockchain interactions.
Interface Development:
File: /frontend/src/components/StakeForm.jsx - Develop the staking form.
File: /frontend/src/components/RewardsDisplay.jsx - Create a component to display user rewards.


5. Deployment Scripts
Prepare for Deployment:
File: /scripts/deploy_tokens.js - Script to deploy the LPtoken and RewardToken.
File: /scripts/deploy_yield_farm.js - Script to deploy the YieldFarm contract.
Testing and Migration:
File: /scripts/testnet_deploy.js - Test deployment script for deploying all contracts to a testnet.


6. Documentation
Code Documentation:
Folder: /docs - Create markdown files or inline comments to document the functionalities and usage.


7. Final Review and Optimization
Code Review:
Go through all contracts and scripts to ensure code quality and security.
Optimize gas usage and ensure compliance with best practices.
